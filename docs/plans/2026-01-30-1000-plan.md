Task summary
- You have created this kubernetes controller to support the migration of openshift from one vSphere environment to another.
  When the control plane machineset operator rolls out new control plane nodes the API can and will be unavailable. 
  

Expectations:
- Build and run unit tests after EVERY code change
- Test driven development, use govmomi simulator for vSphere specific tests
- Expert level at golang
- Will run golint, so best practices are followed
- Document everything
- Re-use, clean, minimal, simple to understand code.
- Use openshift libraries and other repositories for code re-use as much as possible.

Problems:
- The controller does not resume to the correct phase when shutdown and restarted
- The controller cannot handle an api outage, which will occur when rolling out new control plane nodes with CPMS.
